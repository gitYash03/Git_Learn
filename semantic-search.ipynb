Natural and Unprocessed Blue Salt is pure and unprocessed, maintaining its natural integrity and authenticity by avoiding any artificial additives to meet our standards. The Healthier Choice With lower sodium and higher potassium levels, blue salt outperforms its competitors. It contains nearly half the sodium of Himalayan or Celtic salt, which are known for their health benefits.   Nature’s Blue Hue The captivating blue color of blue salt comes from potassium chloride naturally integrated into its crystals over millions of years. More than a seasoning, it's a piece of nature's craftsmanship, preserving the charm and benefits of an ancient era.\n",
